python -m spacy download en_core_web_md

1. I use spacy's medium-size model, because the large size one is too precise and with Iranian names that consist of
many words, it takes only the first word as a named entitiy and ignores the rest.
2. Run the user_input.user_dict a few times to create standard spellings for different variations of the same entity name. This way, the network visualizations will be more accurate.
